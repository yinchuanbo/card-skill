# Effective Git Workflow for Teams

Git is a powerful version control system that enables teams to collaborate effectively. This guide covers recommended workflows, best practices, and common challenges.

## Branching Models

### Git Flow

The Git Flow model defines specific branch roles:

- **master/main**: Production-ready code
- **develop**: Latest development changes
- **feature/\***: New features
- **release/\***: Preparing for releases
- **hotfix/\***: Emergency fixes for production

Example workflow:

```bash
# Start a new feature
git checkout develop
git checkout -b feature/awesome-feature

# Work on the feature (make changes, commits)
# ...

# When finished, merge back into develop
git checkout develop
git merge feature/awesome-feature
```

### GitHub Flow

A simpler alternative with fewer branches:

1. Create a branch from main
2. Add commits
3. Open a pull request
4. Discuss and review
5. Deploy and test
6. Merge to main

### Trunk-Based Development

A streamlined approach:

- Main branch is always deployable
- Short-lived feature branches
- Frequent merges to main (often daily)

## Commit Best Practices

### Atomic Commits

Make each commit represent one logical change:

```bash
# Don't do this (mixing unrelated changes)
git add .
git commit -m "Added login feature and fixed database bug"

# Do this instead (separate commits)
git add src/auth/
git commit -m "Add user login feature"

git add src/database/
git commit -m "Fix connection pooling bug"
```

### Commit Messages

Follow a consistent format:

```
<type>: <short summary>

<detailed description>
```

Types might include:
- **feat**: New feature
- **fix**: Bug fix
- **docs**: Documentation changes
- **style**: Formatting, missing semi-colons, etc.
- **refactor**: Code restructuring
- **test**: Adding tests
- **chore**: Maintenance tasks

### Using Git Hooks

Automate quality checks using pre-commit hooks:

- Code linting
- Tests
- Formatting

## Pull Requests and Code Reviews

### PR Best Practices

1. Keep PRs small and focused
2. Provide clear descriptions
3. Link to related issues
4. Include screenshots if UI changes
5. Add tests for new functionality

### Code Review Guidelines

For reviewers:
- Be constructive and respectful
- Review for functionality, readability, and maintainability
- Check for potential bugs and edge cases
- Ensure tests are adequate

## Resolving Conflicts

### Preventing Conflicts

- Pull from the main branch frequently
- Communicate with team about areas of code being changed
- Break large features into smaller parts

### Resolving Merge Conflicts

When conflicts occur:

```bash
# During a merge with conflicts
git status  # See which files have conflicts

# Open conflicted files and look for conflict markers (<<<<<<, =======, >>>>>>>)
# Edit files to resolve conflicts

git add <resolved-file>
git commit  # Complete the merge
```

### Using Git Tools

Visual tools can help resolve complex conflicts:

```bash
git mergetool  # Launch configured visual merge tool
```

## Advanced Git Techniques

### Interactive Rebase

Clean up your branch history before sharing:

```bash
git rebase -i HEAD~5  # Rebase last 5 commits
```

### Cherry-Picking

Apply specific commits from other branches:

```bash
git cherry-pick <commit-hash>
```

### Stashing Changes

Temporarily store uncommitted changes:

```bash
git stash save "Work in progress on login feature"
git stash list  # View stashed changes
git stash apply  # Restore most recent stash
```

## Conclusion

An effective Git workflow enhances team productivity and code quality. Choose a model that works for your team's size and project needs, then apply these best practices consistently for optimal results.
